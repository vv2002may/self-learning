   TODO: Modify the code to synchronize the `bookTicket` and `getAvailableTickets` methods.

   1. **Add Synchronization to `bookTicket` Method**:
      - The `bookTicket` method must be made thread-safe to avoid race conditions when multiple threads try to book tickets simultaneously.
      - Use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can execute this method at a time.
      - Add `synchronized` before the method declaration to prevent multiple threads from accessing the ticket booking logic at the same time.

   2. **Add Synchronization to `getAvailableTickets` Method**:
      - The `getAvailableTickets` method should also be synchronized to ensure consistent access to the `availableTickets` variable.
      - Synchronizing this method will prevent other threads from making booking decisions based on stale or incorrect data.

      **Why Synchronization is Important**:
      - Without synchronization, multiple threads can simultaneously read and modify the `availableTickets` variable, leading to incorrect results (e.g., overselling tickets).
      - Synchronization ensures that each thread completes its operation on the shared resource (`availableTickets`) before another thread can modify it.
